1. One technical concept that I developed a greater mastery of was the coding language **HTML**. When designing this **portfolio**, I had to split the webpage into **sections**. I was able to achieve this by assigning elements with **attributes** like `Id` and `class` to separate elements with unique properties

```html
   <header id="here">
    <a id="top" href="#section-a">JCA.DEV</a> // Id is only assigned to this, allowing us to only modify this property

    <nav id="stick">
      <a class="goto" href="#home">HOME</a>
      <a class="goto" href="#about">ABOUT</a>
      <a class="goto" href="#projects">PROJECTS</a>
      <a class="goto" href="#contact">CONTACT</a>
    </nav>
  </header>
```

2.  One challenge was making the overall layout of the **CSS** due to the fact of how **unorganized** everything was. When making my CSS It all the properties were **scattered**, making modifying the webpage difficult due to not knowing what was where any code was. Luckly after finishing my webpage, I’d **sorted** everything and put everything in its place and remove what was **unneeded**. 

3. AI assisted me in quickly getting a **rundown** of the elements or properties I needed for my HTML or CSS


This project provided me an opportunity to build something with AI assistance. Check out my [AI Usage Document](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1x6_weVhufWzeUJcSjR0XGp51XpsJi7swiqzktmbkR7o/edit?usp=sharing) to see how I used AI on this project.
